# Blame Analysis: Comprehensive Suite Report

## 🏁 Diagnostic Verdict (Fault Attribution)
**Verdict:** **Local Wi-Fi Bottleneck** + **WAN Bufferbloat**.
**Confidence:** **90%**
**Root Cause:** **Wi-Fi 2.4GHz/Congestion** limits speed to ~33 Mbps. **Router Bufferbloat** causes lag (200ms+) during uploads.

### Evidence Summary
-   **Local Gateway Reachability:** **PASS** (RTT: 3.7 ms).
-   **WAN Reachability:** **PASS** (Google RTT: 15.9 ms).
-   **Symptom:** **Slow Wi-Fi** (33 Mbps vs 900 Mbps Wired) and **Lag Spikes** under load.

## 📡 Signal & Connectivity (Layer 1-2)
| Test | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Wi-Fi Signal (RSSI)** | **-43 dBm** | **Excellent**. You are close to the router. |
| **Link Rate (PHY)** | **24.0 - 180.0 Mbps** | Fluctuation suggests interference or legacy client compatibility. |
| **Frequency** | **Unknown** | Likely 2.4GHz given the speeds. |
| **SSID** | `Scuderia Ferrari` | Connected. |

## 🌍 Reachability & Availability (Layer 3-4)
| Probe Target | Protocol | RTT (p50) | RTT (p99) | Loss % | Success |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Gateway** | ICMP | 3.7 ms | 4.5 ms | 0% | ✅ |
| **Google DNS** | UDP/53 | 16 ms | **152 ms** | 0% | ✅ (Jitter!) |
| **Web Search** | HTTP | 135 ms | - | 0% | ✅ |
| **DNS Resolution** | DNS | **5020 ms** | - | - | ⚠️ (IPv6 Timeout?) |

## 🚀 Performance & Throughput (Speed)
| Path | Provider | Download (Mbps) | Upload (Mbps) | Latency (Unloaded) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Wired** | **Reflector (LAN)** | **940 Mbps** | **938 Mbps** | **0.2 ms** |
| **Wired** | **Ookla (WAN)** | **840 Mbps** | **220 Mbps** | **15.1 ms** |
| **Wi-Fi** | **Ookla (WAN)** | **33.5 Mbps** | **40.0 Mbps** | **18.9 ms** |

### Bufferbloat Analysis (Wired Upload)
-   **Unloaded Latency:** 15.1 ms
-   **Loaded Latency:** **228.6 ms**
-   **Delta:** +213 ms -> **Grade: F (Severe Lag)**.
    *Recommendation: Enable SQM (Smart Queue Management) on your router to fix gaming lag.*

### Service Value Scoreboard
-   **Plan Speed:** (Assumed Gigabit)
-   **Measured:** **90%** (Wired), **3%** (Wi-Fi).
-   **Cost Efficiency:** You are getting what you pay for ONLY on Ethernet.

## 🕵️ Advanced Diagnostics
| Feature | Status | Observation |
|---|---|---|
| **DNS Visibility** | **WARN** | Slow resolution (5s). IPv6 config check recommended. |
| **Device Identification** | `04:99...` | Router MAC OUI found. |
| **Node Integrity** | **PASS** | Pi 5 healthy. |
| **Anomalous Traffic** | - | Bufferbloat detected on upstream. |

## 🧠 AI Assessment (Natural Language)
"Your internet connection is excellent (Gigabit capacity), but your experience is degraded by two factors:
1.  **Wi-Fi is the main bottleneck:** Speeds drop from 900 Mbps to 33 Mbps. This is likely due to using the 2.4GHz band or legacy settings.
2.  **Bufferbloat:** When uploading files (even on wired), latency spikes from 15ms to 200ms+. This causes lag in games/calls.
**Fix:** Switch to 5GHz Wi-Fi and enable QoS/SQM on your router."
